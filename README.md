# Diwali_Sales_Analysis

This is the basic analysis of the buyers in the Diwali season, considering who can afford to buy more things and which region has the highest buyer rate.

## Project Learnings
- Performed data cleaning and manipulation.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** libraries.
- Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, gender and age groups.
- Improved sales by identifying the most popular product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.

## Dashboard
I have also designed a dashboard in **PowerBI** which considers the important factors.
